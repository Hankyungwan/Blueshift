this is the local manifest. to learn more about it, see this article:

NOTE: beware, this is: automatically regenerated by the Laboratory every time you make a change. you may make another file, called "extremely_local_manifest.xml" and Laboratory will automatically merge the two (obviously, it is added last)

	<!--
	for example, to remove a project and replace it with your own fork, Laboratory will automatically generate this:

	<remove-project path="node_modules/MachineShop" name="heavyk/MachineShop" />
	<project path="github_user/MachineShop" name="github_user/MachineShop" remote="[github_user]" />
	-->
</manifest>
